ec,"Installing five eddy covariance stations in the LTSER areas is of utmost importance as it enables direct measurements of ecosystem-scale fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other greenhouse gases. <br>These stations provide critical insights into the net exchange of gases between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere, allowing scientists to quantify carbon sequestration rates, assess ecosystem productivity, and understand the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. <br>The data obtained from these stations greatly enhance our understanding of the carbon cycle and contribute to informed decision-making for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in the LTSER areas."
ws,"Measuring weather parameters in a Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) area is crucial for understanding the complex interactions between the environment and human systems over extended periods. <br> These measurements will provide invaluable data for assessing climate change impacts, ecosystem dynamics, and informing sustainable land management strategies, aiding in the development of evidence-based policies and practices.<br>The deployment of 20 weather stations in the LTSER area will greatly enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution of weather data collection. <br>This comprehensive network of stations will enable researchers to capture localized weather patterns, identify microclimatic variations, and assess the influence of topography on weather conditions, leading to a more holistic understanding of the area's ecological processes and facilitating targeted conservation and management efforts."
cu,"CUV5 is a general-purpose instrument measuring the total UV radiation from natural sunlight for applications in meteorology and outdoor material testing.
The high quality dome and diffuser provide optimized directional response. A specially designed optical filter provides sensitivity to combined UVA and UVB irradiance. The photodiode generates a voltage output linearly proportional to the UV intensity. 
Specific parts of the UV spectrum such as UVA, UVB or UVE / UV Index cannot be derived from the CUV5 measurements. For measurement of these individual parameters our specific SUV models are required."
co,"Large scale soil and surface biomass moisture measurement is possible using Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS). Counting the backscattered neutrons generated by the interaction between cosmic ray (fast neutrons) from the sky and water present in the soil and surface biomass (leaf litter and grass).
As a noninvasive automatic method for estimating soil moisture at intermediate scale, the cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is able to bridge the scale gap between the point scale and the large scale (Baroni et al., 2018; Franz et al., 2015; Jeong et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2018; Vather et al., 2019). CRNP takes advantage of the negative correlation between fast neutrons and the hydrogen pool around CRNP (Franz et al., 2016; Jakobi et al., 2022; Zreda et al., 2008). Hydrogen atoms are commonly present in the soil as soil moisture, so soil moisture can be inferred using fast neutron intensity.
The CRNP horizontal measurement footprint is a circular area with a radius of 130â€“240 m, depending on air humidity, soil moisture, and vegetation (Desilets et al., 2010). The measurement depth ranges from 15 to 83 cm, depending mainly on the soil moisture and distance from the sensor (Jakobi et al., 2021; Kohli et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2019)."
ra,"RaZON+ is an all-in-one system that accurately measures both direct normal irradiance (DNI) and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) from the sun and sky, enabling it to provide very reliable values of global horizontal solar irradiance (GHI) and sunshine duration.
The integrated data logger presents the irradiance measurements in W/m2, sunshine duration in hours and energy in kWh/m2 (kilowatt-hours per square meter)."
